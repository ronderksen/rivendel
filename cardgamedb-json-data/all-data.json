    "link": "The way Heavy Stroke is intended to work depends on allowing players to choose which character's attack value is applied to the enemy's defense value. For example, the optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply Aragorn's attack 3 to an enemy's 1 defense. So Aragorn is dealing 2 damage to the enemy and Dwalin is also dealing 2 damage, at which point you play Heavy Stroke to double Dwalin's damage and make it 4 for a total of 6 damage dealt to the enemy.\n\nJust to clarify it further, let's say Aragorn and Dwalin were attacking an enemy with 4 defense. The optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply all 3 of Aragron's attack plus 1 of Dwalin's to beating the enemy's defense, then Dwalin would deal 1 damage to the enemy that could be double with Heavy Stroke for a total of 2.

Since he did wipe out an entire dwarf army when he conquered Erebor, it seems fitting that Smaug be capable of doing this in the game as well. Also, because Smaug is pretty much the only enemy in the scenario (aside from a few small birds), it is important that he be able to attack more than just one time each round.\nIf it's any comfort, we play-tested that scenario extensively and even did a mathematical analysis of how often Smaug will attack on average. While he's capable of making more than 3 attacks in a single combat phase, it's not that likely. Of course there's no accounting for luck.\nI have made a note to include some additional information about shadow cards in the next FAQ.",

Beginning with the first player, each player reveals 1 encounter card and resolves its staging before the next player reveals a card. If an encounter card has an effect that uses the word “you” then the encounter card is referring to the player who revealed the card. If the revealed encounter has the Surge keyword, the player who revealed that card reveals an additional encounter card. Encounter cards with the Doomed X keyword still affecteach player. Burning X: Burning X is a new keyword used in Blood in Breland. When a card with Burning X is revealed from the encounter deck the player that revealed it must choose to either remove progress from the quest stage (but not the active location) or do damage to characters he controls equal to X. If there are no progress tokens on the quest stage the player must do damage to characters he controls instead. Peril: Peril is a new keyword found in The Lord of the Rings Saga Expansion and used here. When a player reveals an encounter card with the Peril keyword, he must resolve the staging of that card on his own without conferring with the other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger any responses during the resolution of that card's staging.",
